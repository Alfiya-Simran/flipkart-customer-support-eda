# 📊 Flipkart Customer Support EDA

This project presents an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Flipkart's customer support system to uncover patterns affecting customer satisfaction (CSAT). The analysis is structured around Univariate, Bivariate, and Multivariate visualizations, following a business-driven approach to optimize support efficiency and improve user experience.

## 🔍 Objectives
- Analyze customer support interactions to understand satisfaction drivers.
- Identify patterns by channel, issue type, agent shift, and experience.
- Explore relationships between response time, agent tenure, and CSAT.
- Recommend data-backed improvements to increase CSAT and reduce ticket volume.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📈 Key Insights
- Inbound channels and order-related issues dominate ticket volume.
- Experienced agents deliver higher CSAT and faster responses.
- Monday sees the highest ticket inflow — staffing should align with trends.
- Night shifts show lower satisfaction, highlighting operational gaps.

## 📌 Outcome
- 20+ well-commented charts (UBM structure)
- Production-ready, error-free notebook
- Actionable business recommendations

## 🧑‍💻 Project Type
